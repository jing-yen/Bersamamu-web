# bersamamu-web
The Bersamamu multiplatform app, built with React JS.

This repository was the Github Pages repo for Bersamamu Web. Considering that Bersamamu has successfully served its purpose during the lockdown and flood periods, I have let go of the domain name, hence it is now on https://jing-yen.github.io. 

Bersamamu Web is built to offer a near-native experience on all platforms, especially iOS, Android and Windows. Hence, the Bersamamu platform is able to reach and assist more lives than before, in comparison to when only the Android app was made available.

In addition, the instant access to Bersamamu Web, and the easiness of sharing links to donations and requests, has made it easier for both kind Samaritans and people in need to utilize the platform. As of early 2023, Bersamamu has more than 1000 users.

The Android app can be found here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jingyen.charity. There are quite a few reviews inside :)
